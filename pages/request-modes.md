# Request Modes

## In order

Fairly straight forward, requests are played in a first come, first served basis.

## Random

Again, fairly straight forward, requests are played COMPLETELY randomly.

## Random (smart mode)

This is where the fun begins.

In Settings > Randomizer, you can enable a smart mode which does multiple things.

- Adds the 3 previous requesters to an invisible list, preventing them from being picked in a row, unless no other requests are available.

- Allows Sub/VIP/Mod bias, each step of 1 is equivalent to a 10% chance.
  - *Example: setting sub bias to 2 will give subscribers who have requested a song an extra 20% chance of having their request picked first.*

### Note for entire transparency

- The main developer, **TheOtherLeaf** has an obligatory 60% chance of being picked first in smart randomizer modes.
- Donators do not currently have a bias, but will eventually have a 10-20% chance.
