# Welcome to CREST

If you're wondering how you got here: I don't know.
However, if you were looking for info on [TheOtherLeaf](https://twitch.tv/TheOtherLeaf)'s request bot project, you're in the right place!

## What is CREST

**C**lean **RE**quest **S**ystem for **T**witch

Originally designed as an alternative to JopeBot as a couple friends were having issues with the amount of network traffic that it used. JopeBot has since been discontinued, and [Acai](https://twitch.tv/acai) picking up the "less clean" RequestBotThing project has motivated me to make CREST, a much more "almost" professional production app.

Fun fact, CREST team will never beg you for donations in order to continue working. :)

## Download

You can find the download by clicking [here](https://cloud.whaskell.pw/CREST/Releases/Setup.exe).
Be warned that due to the auto-update method and nature of downloading and copying itself, certain antivirus software may trigger a warning or delete it. This is only linked to auto-updating and cannot be solved without spending a lot of money that I don't have on a code signing certificate, even then that's not sure if it'll solve it.

## Special Thanks

- **[ZantorGaming](https://twitch.tv/zantorgaming)**: For being the longest and most active user, providing feedback, suggestions and bug reports.

- **[Cloudy95](https://twitch.tv/cloudy95)**: For having such bad internet that I had to do something about it. Very early adopter.

- **[Acai](https://twitch.tv/acai)**: Being a great inspiration as a CH player, picking up the bot and showing it off to his amazing viewerbase, shouting me out and deliberately looking out for my messages, it means a lot.

- **My doctor**: for providing me with meds that enable me to be a functional human rather than a depressed waste of oxygen. ðŸ˜ƒ
