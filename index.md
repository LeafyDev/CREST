# Welcome to CREST

If you're wondering how you got here: I don't know.
However, if you were looking for info on [TheOtherLeaf](https://twitch.tv/TheOtherLeaf)'s request bot project, you're in the right place!

## What is CREST

**C**lean **RE**quest **S**ystem for **T**witch

Originally designed as an alternative to JopeBot as a couple friends were having issues with the amount of network traffic that it used. JopeBot has since been discontinued, and [Acai](https://twitch.tv/acai) picking up the "less clean" RequestBotThing project has motivated me to make CREST, a much more "almost" professional production app.
